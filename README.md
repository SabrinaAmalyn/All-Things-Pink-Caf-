# All Things Pink CafÃ© â˜•ðŸŽ€
This is a project I made to relearn the basics of HTML and play around with pixel art! Itâ€™s a cute, pink-themed cafÃ© website with a pastel menu, pixel desserts, and an order form.
Even though it's simple, I had a lot of fun making it. Hope you like this cozy little cafÃ©! 

Below are the screenshots of each section:
